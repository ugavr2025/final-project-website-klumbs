            <strong>Decider VR</strong> is a collaborative VR/MR application
            designed to help groups make shared decisions more easily. Users can
            add and react to options — like where to go or what to do — while an
            AI-powered NPC evaluates and ranks them based on criteria such as
            price, distance, and preferences.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of Decision Maker is to create a more engaging and
            transparent group decision-making process, combining immersive XR
            environments, interactive UI panels, and intelligent AI analysis to
            help users reach fair and efficient outcomes.

              The AI NPC analyzes all submitted options along with user
              preferences and selected criteria. It ranks each option based on
              factors like distance, price, and personal preferences, then
              generates a clear recommendation with a short explanation.

              Decision Maker supports private, multi-user rooms where friends
              join sessions to decide together. In VR, users are represented by
              avatars — either shared or randomly assigned.

              colors, or numerical scores. Each user can add or remove options
              and rank them.
